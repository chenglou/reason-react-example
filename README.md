```sh
git clone https://github.com/chenglou/reason-react-example.git
cd reason-react-example
npm run build
open src/index.html
```

Opening up `src/index.html` file has links to the examples (**no server needed!**). 

To do development work run:

```sh
npm start
```

This builds and watches the files, you can then modify whichever file in `src` and refresh the page to see the changes.
